    "\n",
    "**Use of packages:** For this exercise, in addition to the built-in python functions and elements that we have seen in the lectures (see lecture notes), you can only import the **csv** and **json** packages. No other packages are allowed. You cannot use other packages such as **pandas**, you won't get any marks for a question if you use it.\n",

    "**How to submit:** You will submit a completed Jupyter notebook file with your solutions, as well as a PDF version of the Jupyter notebook which includes the outputs of your code. You need to submit the python code that produces the required answers. Answers produced through means other than python code will not be deemed acceptable.\n",

    "7. We want to implement a small recommender system which, given a movie as input, recommends the most similar movie. The idea behind it is to recommend the movie with the most similar rating pattern to the movie provided as input (e.g. if our input movie has been liked by some users and disliked by others, we will try to recommend one where similar users liked and disliked it). To do this, we will measure the pairwise cosine similarities between the input movie and each of the other movies in the dataset, to find the one that maximises the similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cosine similarity between two vectors (in python, lists) A and B is measured as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{B} / \\|\\mathbf{A}\\| \\|\\mathbf{B}\\| = \\frac{ \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}{A_i  B_i} }{ \\sqrt{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}{A_i^2}} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}{B_i^2}} }$ \n",
    "\n",
    "That's the (element-wise) multiplication of both vectors, divided by the multiplication of their norms. As an example, if we have two vectors:\n",
    "* A = [0, 1, 2]\n",
    "* B = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "The cosine similarity between A and B is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$sim(A, B) = (0 * 1 + 1 * 2 + 2 * 3) / (\\sqrt{0^2 + 1^2 + 2^2} * \\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2}) = 0.956182887$\n",
    "\n",
    "See the toy example below where we have 3 movies and 5 users. Cells with a 0 indicate that the user hasn't rated that movie, whereas values 1-5 indicate that the user has rated the movie with that value:\n",
    "\n",
    "|         | user 1 | user 2 | user 3 | user 4 | user 5 |\n",
    "|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n",
    "| movie 1 |      5 |      0 |      2 |      1 |      5 |\n",
    "| movie 2 |      1 |      3 |      0 |      1 |      4 |\n",
    "| movie 3 |      4 |      0 |      2 |      1 |      0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say in this case our input movie is movie 1, so we want to find the movie that's most similar to movie 1. We would compute the pairwise cosine similarities between movie 1 (our input movie) and every other movie in the dataset:\n",
    "* Cosine similarity between movie 1 and movie 2 is: 0.674699\n",
    "* Cosine similarity between movie 1 and movie 3 is: 0.735612\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, we would recommend movie 3 as the one with the highest cosine similarity with movie 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this question, write a python function which, given a movie as input, outputs the most similar movie as the recommended item based on highest cosine similarity with the input movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(30 marks)**\n",
    "\n",
    "NB that you can only use the *json* and *csv* packages. To calculate the square root of a value, you can use (1/2) as the exponent of a base number, e.g. 3**(1/2) calculates the square root of 3."
